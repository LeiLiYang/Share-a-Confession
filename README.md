# Share-a-Confession
Have you ever wanted to share a crazy story or see other people's crazy stories while remaining anonymous? This is the perfect website for you! It is simple and straightforward to use. On the homepage, you can view other people's most recent confessions. On the writeconfession page, you simply come up with a title and confess away. The frontend is built using React as it allows the website to be easily split into components. Express is used for the backend to handle the routing, and Axios is used to send the HTTP requests swiftly. Finally, to store all the confession data, MongoDB is used. This project was completed by a team of 2.
